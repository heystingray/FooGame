# FooGame
OOD project implementing simple game in Java

The game in this project is a simplified version of the game TAK originating from the Kingkiller Chronicles series by Pat Rothfuss.

It involves 2 players alternating placing or moving stones on a 5x5 grid.

This project makes use of polymorphism, encapsulation of function, and the Observer pattern to create a game that is easily extensible without needing direct modification of the original source files.
It is, for example, quite easy to add new rules or win conditions to the game by creating new inheritors of the Rule and WinCondition classes.
